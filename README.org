* emacs-biome-js

** Description

A hacky integration of [[https://biomejs.dev/][BiomeJS]] and Emacs via a Flycheck backend and a
format-on-save hook.

I am not a talented Lisp hacker so this is very much a
work-in-progress and everyone is strongly encouraged to
contribute/provide feedback.

** Usage

#+begin_src elisp
;; if you want the Flycheck backend
(add-to-list 'flycheck-checkers 'biome)

;; if you want the format-on-save-hook
(add-hook 'js-mode-hook 'biome-js-autosave-mode)
#+end_src
